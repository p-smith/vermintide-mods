title = "Fail level";
description = "Adds the /fail command from Grimalackt's original QoL modpack to instantly trigger a defeated screen, allowing for a faster map restart/return to inn without the need to disband an ongoing party.

Also provides the following extra commands (thanks Zaphio):
/home Go back to the inn, bypassing any end screen.
/restart Restart the current level.
