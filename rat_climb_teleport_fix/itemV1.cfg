title = "Rat teleport fix";
description = "Fixes teleporting rats in several situations:
- Fix for rats skipping climb animations
- Fix for rats skipping landing animation
- Fix for rats skipping animation when jumping across gaps

Note that this may also fix gutter runners from doing instant pounce after skipping climb animations.
Instant pounce is a game design, but now with the fix they will have to wait until the end of the climb animations to do instant pounce.
This doesn't fix visual TP for clients due to lag or rat position desync.
